# Language Learning Flashcards App

This is a simple web app for language learners to create, store, and review flashcards. The app allows users to add their own flashcards with words and their translations (or meanings). It also allows users to review flashcards in a fun and interactive way. The flashcards are stored temporarily in memory (without using a database) and can be reviewed anytime.

## Features

- Add new flashcards with a word and its translation.
- View all added flashcards.
- Simple and clean user interface.
- No database requiredâ€”flashcards are stored in memory (server-side).
- Deployed and accessible via a live link.
